# IExpense

IExpense is an expenses tracking app developed using SwiftUI during the 100 Days of SwiftUI challenge with Hacking with Swift. The app facilitates efficient management of expenses with two key screens: one for adding expenses and another for viewing all expenses.

## Key Learnings

Throughout the development of this project (Days 36-38), the following crucial skills and concepts were mastered:

- **Sheet Presentation**: Implementation of sheet presentation in SwiftUI for seamless user interaction when adding expenses.

- **List Management**: Utilization of ForEach and onDelete callback to manage and delete items in a list efficiently.

- **User Settings**: Integration of UserDefaults class for storing user settings, allowing for a personalized experience.

- **App Storage Property Wrapper**: Leveraging the AppStorage property wrapper provided by SwiftUI for convenient storage of user data. With UserDefaults, the app can store up to 514KB of user data on the device.
